# crispy-goggles

This my attempt to solve some of the [ProjectEuler's problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives) in Haskell.
I started this project as a part of my study to compare Haskell to other languages,
specially [Scala](https://github.com/samskivert/euler-scala).

For most problems, I wrote multiple solutions, which gradually get more compact and somewhat more cryptic!

# Why crispy-googles?
GitHub suggested me the name when I was creating the repository.
I blame GitHub if it's not a cool name!
