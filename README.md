# crispy-gogglesThis my attempt to solve some of the [ProjectEuler's problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives) in Haskell.I started this project as a part of my study to compare Haskell to other languages,specially [Scala](https://github.com/samskivert/euler-scala).# Why crispy-googles?GitHub suggested me the name when I was creating the repository.I blame GitHub if it's not a cool name!
